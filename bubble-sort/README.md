# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort compare adjacent elements in the list, each time, putting in the right order of magnitude, only two elements.
The algorithm hinges on a swap procedure.
Knowing how many time to swap is important when implementing a bubble sort algorithm.
To so rt a list of numbers such as [3,2,1], we need to swap the elements a maximum of twice. This is equal to the length of the list minus 1
