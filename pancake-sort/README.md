# Pancake Sort

Pancake sorting is the colloquial term for the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it.
A pancake number is the maximum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes.
