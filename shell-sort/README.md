# Shell Sort

Shell sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort.
The idea of shell sort is to allow exchange of far items.
In shell sort, we make the array N-sorted for a large value of N.
We keep reducing the value of N until it becomes 1.
An array is said to be N-sorted if all sub-lists of every N'th element is sorted.
