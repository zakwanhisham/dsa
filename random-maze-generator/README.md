# Random Maze generator

A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells with wall sites between them.
This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a connected graph with the edges representing possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells.
The purpose of the maze generation algorithm can be then be considered to be making a sub-graph in which it is challenging to find a route between two particular nodes.
