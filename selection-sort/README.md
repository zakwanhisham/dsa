# Selecrion Sort

This algorithm begins by finding the smallest element in an array and interchanging it with data at, for instance, array index[0].
Starting at index 0, we search for the smallest item in the list that exist between index 1 and the index of the last element.
When this element has been found, it is exchanged with the data found at index 0.
We simply repeat this process until the list becomes sorted.
