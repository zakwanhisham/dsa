# Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "substring" within a main "string" by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.
